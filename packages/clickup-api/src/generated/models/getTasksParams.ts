 * ClickUp API v2 Reference
 * The ClickUp API enables you to programmatically access and manage your ClickUp resources.

## Authentication
The API supports two authentication methods:
- **Personal API Token**: Use for testing and personal integrations. Add token to requests with header: `Authorization: pk_...`
- **OAuth 2.0**: Required for building apps for other users. Uses authorization code flow.

## Getting Started
Our [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.clickup.com/docs/index) provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the ClickUp API.
